Exercise for MSCH-C220
Oct 11, 2023

More steps in adding "juicy" features to a simple brick-breaker game.

## To play

Move the paddle using the mouse. Help the ball break all the bricks before you run out of time.


## Implementation

From the original Game this is what i added in this project
* The game has 3 differnt Levels.
* I replaced the Balls and Paddle with others I created.
* I  to created special effects to  briefly highlight the Ball and Paddle when collisions occur
* I created UI Themes for the project, improved the typeface, created themes to improve the Menus and HUD
* I added particles to the game.
* I replaced the original white rectangles  for the Bricks with nice colored brick sprites and used different Bricks for different point values.
* I added special effects where the Paddle and Bricks respectively emit colorful particles upon collisions.
* I added another special effect that causes the Ball to get distorted and wobbles upon collision
* I improved the Lives Indicator by adding small icons of the Ball and animating the Lives Indicator with a breathing highlight special effect.
* I implemented a special effect that makes the Paddle and its highlight grow larger at times when it moves.
* I implemented another special effect causing the Bricks to emit particles when they are hit then vaporize or their remnants fall off the screen.
* I implemented a special effect that causes the Screen to Shake when a falling ball causes an icon in the Lives Indicator to die and disappear.
* I implemented an animation special effect at the beginning of the game that makes the Bricks appear like if they were falling from above.
* I implemented an AudioStreamPlayer
* I added 3 pieces of music to be played for the 3 different Game Levels. I created music1 and music2 myself, and music3 was downloaded from freesound.org
* I created 3 soundeffects for the Paddle, the Brick and the Wall when they collide with the Ball. I downloaded the soundeffect for the Sound_Die from freesound.org to play when an icon disappears on the Lives Indicator
* I implemented the Comet Trail effect for the ball.
* I implemented the Swaying effect of the bricks making them move like Jelly.
* I added a Shader to the Main Menu (Water Shader)
* I added a Shader causing a burning fire on the Fever Bar (Fire Shader). It turns on when it's feverish and turns off when it's not.
* I made the Fever Bar more colorful by adding an animated red color when not in fever mode.
* I added a Shader to the background to cause a Firewoks animation that turns on when  Fever mode is on but turns off when Fever mode is off. (Fireworks Shader)
* I implemented  an animation showing subtle changes in the background with Rotating Background Colors when not in Fever mode.
* I created some Face Sprites at Piskel.com and draw them on the Paddle.
* I animated the eyes and the mouth of the Paddle face. The eyes follow the ball wherever it is on the screen, and the mouth opens and closes to smile
