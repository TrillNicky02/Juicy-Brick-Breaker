Exercise for MSCH-C220
Oct 5, 2023

More steps in adding "juicy" features to a simple brick-breaker game.

## To play

Move the paddle using the mouse. Help the ball break all the bricks before you run out of time.


## Implementation

In this version many many more interesting features  were implemented
* I implemented the AudioStreamPlayer
* I added 3 pieces of music to be played for the 3 different game levels. I created music1 and music2 myself, and music3 was downloaded from freesound.org
* I created 3 soundeffects for the paddle, the brick and the wall. I downloaded the soundeffect for the Sound_Die from freesound.org
* I implimented the Comet Trail effect for the ball
* I implimented the Swaying effect of the bricks
